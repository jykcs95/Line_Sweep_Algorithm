# Line_Sweep_Algorithm
This program that demonstrates how Line Sweep Algorithm can be used to find line intersections.
It will show step by step how the algorithm runs by displaying the Sweep Line Status, and Event-Point schedule as the code runs.
The algorithm itself is ultimately based on the Shamos-Hoey Algorithm.
The time complexity of the code is higher because of animating aspect of the algorithm.
